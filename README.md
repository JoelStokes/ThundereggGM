# Thunderegg (GM)
Isometric RPG with Monster-Catching & Taming mechanics for GameMaker.

After initial testing, the focus of an Isometric 2.5D Overworld, while theoretically possible, is not ideal for GameMaker. Having to place objects & tiles in a 2D environment and re-draw as isometric at runtime will make it more difficult for both level designers and artists. Also, the added difficulties of Isometric collisions having to be written from scratch due to it being an unsupported style from GameMaker's normal collision types adds a large amount of unecessarily complexity, and could potentially grow into large-scale issues when developing future features.

As of now, this repository is kept for historical purpose, and primary development will switch to the [Godot Thunderegg Project](https://github.com/JoelStokes/Thunderegg).
